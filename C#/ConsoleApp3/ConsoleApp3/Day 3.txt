Object type is the base type for all other types in C#

Reasons not to use object as input parameter type:

1.Loose type safety
2.unwanted boxing 

Generics: allows us to design classes or methods but defer the specification of types until the class or method is declared or called. 

Use Case of Generics:

Interface: 

1. Interface is a collection of methods which are by default abstract and public and will be implemented by the derived classes. 
2. One class can implement multiple interfaces. 
3. Interface cannot be instantiated. 
4. Interface is helpful in writing loosely coupled code. 

Abstract class vs Interface:

1. Abstract class will provide a base class to its subclasses; is a wise choice when we have a clear class hierarchy'
Interface will define common behaviors or functionalities that can be implemented by any class

2.One class can only inherit from one abstract or concrete class but one class can implement multiple interfaces

IRepository: Common CRUD
ICustomerRepository: GetCustomerByEmail, GetCustomerByCity
CustomerRepository: IRepository, ICustomerRepository

3. Methods in abstract class can be abstract method or non-abstract method. For methods in an interface, they are all public and abstract by default. 

SOLID Principles

S: Single Responsibility Principle : a class should only have one reason to change; one class will only be responsible to do one thing

Frontend: web pages to interact with users
Backend:

1.Controller/Web layer: handle request/response, validation, security check
2.Service layer/ Business layer: business logic
3. Data layer/Repository layer: talk to the database
4. other classes:
--utility class: convert data types
--helper class: conclude funtionalities like factory
--entity class: ORM
--Constants

O: Open/closed principle:  software entities like classes, modules, functions should be open for extension but closed for modification
-- use extension methods or inheritance

L: Liskov Substitution Principle: derived classes should be substitutable for their base types

I: Interface Segregation Principle: clients should not be forced to depend on the interfaces they do not use

CustomerRepository, ProductRepository
Common: GetById, GetAll, Create, Update, Delete
GetByCategory, GetByEmail

One way:
Single Interface IRepository: GetById, GetAll, Create, Update, Delete, GetByCategory, GetByEmail

Another way:
IRepository: GetById, GetAll, Create, Update, Delete
ICustomerRepository: GetByEmail
IProductRepository: GetByCategory

CustomerRepository: IRepository, ICustomerRepository
ProductRepository: IRepository, ICustomerRepository

D: Dependency Inversion Principle: depend on abstractions instead of concrete classes, helps to achieve loosley coupled code,
 going to implement it with the help of dependency injection 

Collections:

1.Non-generic collection: take objects, one collection can contain different types of elements
2. Generic collection: specify the type 

Advantages of generic collection:

1. Type safety
2. Better Performance 
3. Flexibility
4. Maintainability
